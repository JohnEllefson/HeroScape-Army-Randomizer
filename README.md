# Overview

This is a HeroScape Army Randomizer which generates random armies for each player according to various settings that the user can edit. HeroScape is a tabletop wargame in which players draft figures to make their army and then fight it out, but this program allows players to create entirely random armies to play with for a different experience. This program was created as practice to familiarize myself with C#/Windows Forms.
